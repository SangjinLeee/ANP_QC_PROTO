1. Set Up Fishbowl API Connection:

    Create a script to establish a connection to the Fishbowl API. Since you already have login credentials, you can use the Login API to authenticate.

    After logging in, maintain the session to streamline interactions with other APIs (e.g., Integrations, Products, Inventory, Manufacture Orders).

2. Determine Integration Approach:

    Decide whether to connect directly from the database to Fishbowl or use an intermediary CSV file to transmit data to Fishbowl. Since you have a QC database, a database-to-Fishbowl connection via API may be more efficient and maintain real-time synchronization.

3. Map Relevant QC Data to Fishbowl Fields:

    Map specific QC data fields (e.g., product specifications, lot numbers, test results) to relevant fields in Fishbowl.

    Use the Products and Inventory APIs to update inventory data, Manufacture Orders for linking manufacturing records, and CSV API if you want to experiment with batch updates.

4. Implement Data Transfer Functions:

    Develop functions to retrieve data from your QC database and send updates to Fishbowl. For example:

        Use the Inventory API to add or update inventory based on QC test results.
        Use the Products API to adjust product details if necessary.

5. Automate Data Sync and Error Handling:

    Schedule regular intervals to push data from the QC database to Fishbowl (e.g., using a cron job or timed script).

    Include logging and error handling to capture any issues during API requests.
6. Test the Full Integration Workflow:

    Test each part of the integration, from authentication to data push, ensuring each API endpoint updates Fishbowl as expected.
