1. Product Specifications Mapping 
    (Products API, Inventory API, Integrations API)
    
    Suggested Mapping:
        Product Name: product in QC Database → productName in Fishbowl.
        
        Lot Number: lot_number → Store in a custom field in Fishbowl or link it with lot-based tracking if Fishbowl supports it for traceability.
        
        Specifications: Use the Products API to attach these specifications as attributes or tags. In Fishbowl, each QC metric can be stored as custom fields within the product details.

2. Inventory Tracking
    (Inventory API)

    Suggested Mapping:
        Lot Number in QC Database → Use lot tracking in Fishbowl or a unique identifier field.
        
        roduct Status (from QC testing pass/fail) → Update inventory availability or warehouse location in Fishbowl based on QC results.

3. Manufacture Orders & Parts Association
    (Manufacturer Order, Parts API)

    Suggested Mapping:
        Part Numbers: Link product in QC to partNumber in Fishbowl.
        
        Manufacturing Readiness: Pass or fail status in QC can trigger Manufacture Orders if the QC process approves parts.

4. Suppliers and Vendors (for Traceability).
    (Vendors API)

    Suggested Mapping:
        Supplier Details: Link any vendor-related fields in your QC database to vendorName or vendorPartNumber in Fishbowl.

5. User & UOM (Unit of Measurement) Management
    (Users API, UOM API)

    Suggested Mapping:
        UOMs in QC data (e.g., μm for particle size, cP for viscosity) → Map to Fishbowl’s UOM setup for consistent measurement handling.

6. Data Flow
    1. Product 6.0J with QC approval and a specific lot_number gets added to Fishbowl as a Product using the Products API.
    2. Specifications (like solid content and moisture) are added as custom fields under this product.
    3. Inventory Availability updates through the Inventory API if the QC results pass.
    4. Manufacture Orders can be created if the product meets QC specifications, linking the product and lot number to ensure traceability.
